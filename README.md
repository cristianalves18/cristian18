###  Hello how are you? :wave:

My name is Cristian Alves, I'm currently a graphic designer. But I'm getting into the career of being a Developer Front-end :computer:. 
And learning and creating various projects with:
<br>
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Node

Obs: I am looking for an Internship to develop myself in the company that is interested in my profile. I will go with the positioning to acquire knowledge. But above all, to show the responsibility of all the challenges that Are put to me. :wink:
